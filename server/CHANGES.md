# Backend Enhancement Changes

The following improvements were made to the backend of the MedThing application:

## Authentication System

1. **JWT Authentication**
   - Improved token generation with additional claims (name, specialization)
   - Added proper token validation with signing method verification
   - Added token expiration checking
   - Made JWT secret configurable via environment variables

2. **New Auth Endpoints**
   - Added `/api/auth/me` - Get current user info
   - Added `/api/auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token

3. **Improved Authentication Security**
   - Added email uniqueness validation
   - Enhanced password handling with bcrypt
   - Implemented consistent response formats
   - Added proper validation of input fields

## Rate Limiting

1. **Implemented Rate Limiting**
   - Added IP-based rate limiting (20 requests per minute)
   - Applied to authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks
   - Added background cleanup routine to prevent memory leaks

## Middleware Improvements

1. **Enhanced JWT Middleware**
   - Improved token validation and error handling
   - Better error messages and response formats

2. **Added Logging Middleware**
   - Added request logging for better debugging and monitoring

3. **Improved CORS Settings**
   - Added Authorization header to allowed headers

## Error Handling

1. **Standardized Error Responses**
   - All API responses now follow a consistent format:
     ```json
     {
       "success": true|false,
       "message": "Human-readable message",
       "data": { ... }
     }
     ```
   - Added appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios

## Security Enhancements

1. **Protected Routes**
   - All API endpoints now require authentication except auth routes
   - Proper route grouping for better organization

2. **Development Features**
   - Auto-creation of default admin account for testing

## Documentation

1. **Added Comprehensive README**
   - API endpoint documentation
   - Authentication process
   - Response format
   - Error handling
   - Getting started guide
   - Security features
